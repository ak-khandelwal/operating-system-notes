# Process

A program under execution. Process is an `active` entity while program is a `passive` entity.

## How a process look like inside a memory

A process in memory is divided into several distinct sections, each serving a different purpose.

| Memory Segment | Typical Contents                                         | Growth Direction |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Stack          | Local variables, function call info                      | ↓ (Downward)     |
| Heap           | Dynamically allocated memory (e.g., using malloc or new) | ↑ (Upward)       |
| Data           | Global and static variables                              | Fixed size       |
| Text           | Executable instructions (Program Code)                   | Fixed size       |

## Operations on a Process

1. Create
2. Schedule, Run
3. Wait/Block
4. Suspend, Resume,
5. Terminate (Resource Deallocation)

## Attributes of a Process

A process has several important attributes that help the operating system manage and control it. These attributes are stored in a structure called the Process Control Block (PCB) (sometimes called a task control block).

eg. pid, type of process (foreground or background),size, priority

## Context

The content of PCB of a process are collectivly known as "context" of that process.

## Context Switching

Context switching is the process where the CPU stops running one process, saves its current state, and loads the saved state of another process so that multiple processes can share the CPU effectively.
