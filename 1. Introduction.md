# Introduction

OS is bridge between user and computer hardware. User directly cannot access or allocate computer resources by himself. Usually it is done by OS.

## Parts of OS

- Kernel
- Shell

## System Call ?

Way for programs to interact with OS

## Dual Mode Of OS

- User Mode (mode bit = 1)
- Kernel Mode (mode bit = 0)

# Types of OS

## Uni-programming OS

One process (p1) reside in the memory.

## Multi-programming OS

OS allows multiple process resides in main memory

- `Degree of the multi-programming os` - no of running processes in main memory

```
q. degree of uni-programming os
a. one
```

### Types of multi-programming OS

1. `Preemptive`- A process can be forcefully taken out of CPU.
2. `Non-preemptive` - A process use CPU till its wish

## multi-tasking OS

Extension of multi-programming OS in which processes execute in round-robin fashion.

## Multi-User OS

Allows multiple user to access single system simultaneously

## Multi-processing OS

OS is used in computer systems with multiple CPUs

### Types of multi-process OS

1. Tightly Coupled System (Shared-memory)
2. Loosely Coupled System (Distributed system)

## Embedded OS

a specialized operating system designed to run on embedded devices

`note:`An embedded system is a specialized computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system.

## Real Time OS

a specialized operating system designed to run on embedded devices

### Types of Real Time OS

1. Hard RTOS - no relaxatation on deadlines
2. Soft RTOS - some relaxatation in deadlines

## Handheld Device OS
